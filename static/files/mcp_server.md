I built an MCP Server using Typescript and this is how I did it.

## My Code

```typescript
const idx = 0;
const str = "Hello World!";
console.log(str);
```

## Features

Here are some features of my MCP Server:

- Written in TypeScript
- Uses WebSockets for communication
- Supports JSON-based messages
- Handles multiple clients concurrently

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the server:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/fake/mcp-server.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd mcp-server`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Screenshot

The MCP Server provides the following API endpoints:

| Endpoint        | Method | Description                        |
|---------------|--------|--------------------------------|
| `/connect`    | POST   | Establishes a new client connection |
| `/message`    | POST   | Sends a message to the server       |
| `/disconnect` | POST   | Disconnects a client               |
